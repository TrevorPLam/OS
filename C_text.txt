Scheduling automation
for sales, marketing, and
customer success teams

Meetings with customers — and the activities surrounding scheduling —
are the lifeblood of revenue teams.
When we say “revenue teams,” we’re talking about sales, marketing and
customer success departments who attract sales leads, turn those leads
into meetings with prospective customers, and then close and retain
those customers.
And like every other task used to increase revenue, the scheduling of
those meetings deserves automation.
Everything else
is automated —
why not scheduling?
Today, nearly everything in a revenue team’s day-to-day work is
automated. Enriching a customer relationship management (CRM)
database with contacts, looking up phone numbers for cold outreach,
emailing prospects, and more — all automated. Except for scheduling
the meetings where customer relationships are solidified. The meeting
lifecycle still suffers from too much manual effort.
Revenue-generating activities happen before and after a salesperson
meets with a prospect: to move a deal along, to close, and to onboard
with customer success. And your scheduling automation platform
needs to automate and support those activities.

Why now is the time
to automate your
meeting lifecycle
Automating meeting scheduling has become crucial for revenue
teams to enable faster connections and cut the time between
meeting milestones in half.
Let’s stop and think about the revenue lifecycle.
The first step occurs when a prospect fills out a form — often
deployed by a marketing department’s demand generation
team — or responds to an email and is routed to a sales
development representative (SDR) for a discovery call.
Then, often, the SDR sends the lead to the account executive
to schedule a demo.
The third meeting sometimes includes additional stakeholders
and influencers.
The fourth may include the client’s IT team to ensure the
product fits within their enterprise software stack.
Subsequent calls may involve procurement and legal until
the contract is signed.

=== PAGE 4 ===
https://pages.calendly.com/rs/482-NMZ-854/images/scheduling-automation-teams.p1d2f/30/25, 3:12 AM
Once a deal is closed, the salesperson schedules a kick-off between their
colleague in customer success and the customer. Then, customer success
leads the customer through the implementation process and schedules
quarterly touchpoints with both the customer success manager (CSM)
and account executive (AE) for expansion opportunities.
Throughout the revenue lifecycle, meeting reminders, follow-ups,
and emails are exchanged.
Without scheduling automation, a manual process would severely
affect team productivity, the customer experience, and ultimately
revenue generation.
So why has it taken so long to automate such an important aspect
of the revenue meeting lifecycle?

The focus on outbound
Prior to 2010, revenue teams wasted
their time on the back and forth: “Does
2 p.m. work? No, what about 4:30 p.m.?”
After 2010, sharing a scheduling link that
showed your available times became
the de facto process for prospects and
customers to schedule meetings with
revenue teams.
Today, with more than 10 million users
and 50,000 corporate customers,
Calendly is the undisputed category
leader when it comes to outbound
scheduling. When people less familiar
with Calendly think of its core usage,
outbound activity is where their mind
often goes. After all, 93% of sales teams
who report using Calendly for outbound
achieve faster sales cycles, averaging
a 2x increase in demos scheduled.
But outbound-only scheduling
automation won’t get you to your
best pipeline performance.
Savvy revenue teams use Calendly for inbound
scheduling too. Calendly lets teams instantly qualify
leads and schedule with prospects and customers
— without the revenue professional having to lift
another finger.

Two types of sales motions
“
Outbound Sales Hi, Susan. Would love to show you how our product
can help meet your business needs. Feel free to
share times you’re available, or find a time that
works for you here.”
“
Inbound Sales Learn how our product can help your business.
Schedule a free 30-minute demo by filling out
this form.”
The best revenue teams automate both outbound and inbound
scheduling. The way to meet revenue goals, beat competitors, and
reach more opportunities is speed to connection.
For example: Prospects can click “Book a Demo” on your website, fill
out a form, and immediately schedule a call with an SDR. Automating
demo scheduling lets you respond to prospects first, giving you a
competitive edge.

Now that you’ve learned how both inbound and outbound scheduling
play key roles in successful revenue generation, let’s dive deeper into

Outbound sales
Thousands of salespeople in companies of all sizes share scheduling links
via email, social media, and more.
Via email
Salespeople often include their scheduling links when they
email prospects.
The pros take it to the next level by:
• Inserting their scheduling link into their email signature —
“Book Time With Me”
• Adding their scheduling link to their automated email
“drip” sequences in Outreach, Salesloft, and more
• Adding meeting times to their email when responding to prospects
in Gmail or Outlook (via Calendly for Chrome, Firefox, or Outlook)
By adopting Calendly, Bitly’s outbound SDRs saw a 100% increase
in the number of demos scheduled.
Our outbound SDRs use Calendly scheduling links in their
prospecting emails. Not only do the SDRs come in with a
whole calendar of prospects to speak with but they have
more prospects show up to their meetings.”
Dave Rotholz, head of Bitly’s East coast sales team
And it’s not just Bitly; 88% of Calendly users say meeting no-shows
have decreased.

https://pages.calendly.com/rs/482-NMZ-854/images/scheduling-automation-teams.p1d2f/30/25, 3:12 AM
Via social media
Another popular place to share your scheduling link as a salesperson is
via social media, such as LinkedIn and Twitter.
The pro move here:
• Use the Calendly browser extension for LinkedIn Messaging to easily
add your scheduling link to any LinkedIn message
By adopting Calendly, Bitly’s outbound SDRs saw a 100% increase in
the number of demos scheduled.
The LinkedIn Integration with Calendly helps you save
even more time when booking appointments. The handy
little extension allows you to share your availability with
ease and book meetings much faster, hand-pick times for
VIP conversations with one-offs, and find time that works
for the group you’re messaging with meeting polls.”

Inbound sales
What if your sales team could book meetings while they sleep?
In other words, imagine allowing prospects to come to you via inbound
sales — or demand generation — versus solely relying on outbound sales.
Calendly customer Signpost used inbound scheduling to achieve a 50%
increase in the time they have to focus on sales funnel engagement.
A good tool is one that’s so simple, we can basically
forget about it and let the meetings roll in. That’s
what happened when we implemented Calendly.”
Julia Pan, Sales Enablement, SignPost
Team scheduling pages
Setting up a team scheduling page is the easiest way to dip your sales
team’s toes in inbound scheduling.
Now, a prospect can select from several options to meet with your
team. And you can easily support meetings with several members of
your team because Calendly creates a “Venn diagram of availability”
and only shows times when all required people are available.
For example, the prospect can book a:
• 30-minute meeting with Mary (the account executive
handling discovery)
• 40-minute meeting with Mary and Brian (the sales engineer
leading the demo)
• 20-minute follow-up meeting with Brian to ask technical questions

Add scheduling automation to your website
Many tech-forward sales teams work with their marketing teams —
specifically demand gen — to embed Calendly in their company websites.
For teams who want to take scheduling on their website to the next level,
Calendly Routing lets them instantly qualify and schedule leads right from
their marketing forms.
By adding Calendly Routing to their website forms, Givebutter now sees
70% of qualified leads book demos directly from their website.
Our HubSpot form conversion rates have skyrocketed with
Calendly Routing. Our entire team is thrilled.”
Max Friedman, Givebutter CEO
Crawl → Walk → Run
If the above sounds intimidating, never fear: You can crawl, walk,
and run your way to inbound sales with scheduling automation.
CRAWL Work with your demand gen team to simply add
scheduling automation to your website and allow anyone
to book time with one salesperson.
WALK Set up team scheduling event types such as collective
events (e.g., an AE can join a sales engineer with a prospect)
or Round Robin events (Calendly will automate which
salesperson is chosen for a meeting based on their
availability, equal distribution, or priorities you set).

RUN What if you don’t want to let everyone who comes to your
website book a meeting?
With Calendly Routing, show scheduling pages only to leads
who meet your qualifications, like prospects from specific
industries or companies of a certain size. That way, busy sales
teams can focus on the deals that matter most.
Qualify leads through marketing forms in Marketo or HubSpot,
or build new forms in Calendly. Once visitors fill out the form,
automatically route them to the right booking page based on
their responses, so they can schedule immediately. (For leads
who don’t book, existing routing rules and engines kick in as
usual.)
If you integrate with Salesforce, Calendly can match known
leads or customers directly to their account owner’s booking
page. A behind-the-scenes Salesforce ownership lookup
means no one spends valuable time manually reassigning
leads.

How customer experience
teams can quickly connect
with customers for better
onboarding, retention,
support, and growth
Just as meetings help move a sales deal along, meetings between
customer experience (CX) teams and customers help onboard new users,
upsell new products, and renew subscriptions.
Calendly automates the scheduling of customer meetings to free up CX
pros to focus on product education and retention.
By using Calendly, AgriWebb saw a 75% reduction in wait time to schedule
customer calls.
Calendly has been a key driver in a lot of our growth.
It’s really helped us drive our internal efficiency as a
company, but also in a customer-facing sense from the first
touchpoint all the way through their journey.”
David O’Brien, Head of Success, AgriWebb
When scheduling becomes easier, every aspect of customer experience,
success, and support is improved.

Team scheduling pages
One of the most impactful ways to empower your customer is to allow
them to book a meeting when they need help, want to learn something
new, or, ultimately, learn how you can help them reach their goals. Setting
up a team scheduling page makes it easy
Like the customer success team at Vonage did, organizations can save
85 hours per month — time they’d been wasting on meeting scheduling
— and instead focus on customer impacts, such as meeting prep and
closing more support tickets.
The time to book meetings is non-existent now. But the
biggest benefit for our customers is having the CSMs be
more prepared, more ready to give answers there and
then.”
Chris Williams, Head of Customer Success UK/EMEA, Vonage
Now, your customer can select from several meeting options that fit
their needs at that specific moment. For example:
• Immediate tech assistance from Customer Support
• Best practice discussions with Customer Success
• Renewal questions with Account Management
• Training with Product
Add scheduling automation to your website
Customer success and customer support teams gain numerous benefits
from adding scheduling automation right to their website — especially
on web pages dedicated to current customers or support hubs.

Crawl → Walk → Run
Just as sales and marketing teams can take an incremental approach
to use Calendly, so can CX teams:
CRAWL Simply add scheduling automation to your website and
allow customers to book time with a customer success
manager or support rep.
WALK Set up group scheduling event types such as collective
(e.g., a CSM and product expert join a call to help a
customer set up a new feature/integration) or Round Robin
(Calendly automates which support rep is chosen to help
with an incoming help request based on their availability,
equal distribution of incoming requests, or priorities you set).
RUN What if you could improve your customer health and net
promoter scores by getting customers to the right CX team
member as fast as possible?
Calendly Routing lets you ask qualifying questions — “what
do you need help with?” or “what are your language
preferences?” — so your customer doesn’t get frustrated
trying to connect with the right person.
Based on a customer’s answers, send them to a specific team
member’s booking page. For example, Justin is the expert for
technical onboarding and speaks Korean, so he receives a
customer who indicated they have a setup issue and prefer
to speak in Korean.

Sales, marketing, or
customer experience:
Everyone can benefit
from pre- and post-
meeting automation
Whether you’ve booked a meeting via an outbound email, you’ve
accepted a meeting via your website, or a customer booked a meeting
from your scheduling page, you still need to communicate before and
after a meeting.
Calendly offers Workflows — automation that triggers messages
throughout the meeting lifecycle — from the time a meeting is scheduled
all the way through your follow-up with attendees.
Reduce no-shows and other mistakes
Calendly helps eliminate human errors that detract from your buyer and
customer experience so meetings aren’t missed, canceled, or forgotten.
• Ensure everyone from your team shows up with an email or text
message when a meeting is scheduled, canceled, changed,
or upcoming.
• Never forget to add important meeting details such as a Zoom link
or business address, and don’t worry about time zone math.
https://pages.calendly.com/rs/482-NMZ-854/images/scheduling-automation-teams.pdf 1616

=== PAGE 17 ===
https://pages.calendly.com/rs/482-NMZ-854/images/scheduling-automation-teams.p1d2f/30/25, 3:12 AM
• Gather information ahead of time by having attendees answer
questions as they book the meeting so you know what they need.
• Remind your attendee(s) about the meeting with automated email or
text reminders that you can send days, hours, or minutes beforehand.
• Enable easy rescheduling so your attendees can find a new time,
versus letting the meeting fall off their calendar.
Nurture the prospect/customer
before the meeting
Engaging and impactful meetings with customers require more than
just showing up. With Calendly Workflows, you can make the best first
impression for any meeting to help build your relationship.
• Automatically share customized notes with the meeting agenda
and goals to ensure everyone is on the same page.
• Automatically send event reminders so no one has to scramble last
minute to join the meeting.
• Automatically send informative content so your prospects or
customers feel prepared and ready to engage and ask questions
at the upcoming meeting.
Keep the prospect or customer warm
post-meeting
Your meeting lifecycle isn’t over when the meeting ends. That’s the time
to keep the conversation going so you can get the next meeting, share
something new, or close a deal.
• Send a quick “thank you” to make your attendees feel appreciated
and ready for the next engagement.
• Provide follow-up materials such as an ROI calculator or a customer
survey to allow your prospect or customer to continue their journey
to learn more about your business and share their feedback.

Eliminate admin tasks post-meeting
Take scheduling automation a step further to alleviate the admin tasks
that take up too much time after each meeting or the tasks your team
might forget to do.
• Automatically add the meeting to your CRM so you can properly
track engagement and trust that your data is accurate.
• Use further tech stack integrations to update other platforms/
solutions that fit into your reporting or workflow needs.

Don’t forget about security,
user/data management,
and IT policies
Since everyone in an organization can benefit from scheduling
automation, we often see instances where a bunch of individual users
or small groups have their own Calendly accounts. When that’s the
case, though, your company is missing out on the benefits of having
one centralized account.
Using Calendly as a team is where you’ll unlock the greatest value.
Answer these important security, IT, and operational questions,
and you’ll see what we mean:
Are you meeting compliance requirements
and overall security standards?
Security consciousness is a growing need for companies of all sizes.
With strict regulatory requirements, an organization might need to
address internal policies they want to uphold to ensure their data,
their users and customers, and the overall business are secure.
• Use SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) and System for Cross-
Domain Identity Management (SCIM) provisioning to centrally
manage and authenticate users and securely onboard new users.
• Easily de-provision users to ensure past employees are removed,
or offboard users as their roles/needs change.

https://pages.calendly.com/rs/482-NMZ-854/images/scheduling-automation-teams.p1d2f/30/25, 3:12 AM
• Delete customer and user data in a few simple clicks to stay compliant
with regulatory requirements, and embed Calendly’s data deletion
mechanism within your existing data deletion practices.
• Get support from Calendly experts with security and legal reviews,
so you never have to wonder if you meet compliance or
security requirements.
Do you know who your users are?
If you don’t know who in your organization is using Calendly because
they’re all on different accounts, then you don’t have insights into
success metrics, whether security is being maintained,
or — and this is a big one — billing.
When your whole team shares a Calendly account, you can:
• Manage seats to ensure users who host or participate in external
meetings have a Calendly seat, and spread any unused seats to
other users that need them.
• Check usage and pull reports in Calendly to verify users are active,
and track the performance of meetings and campaigns in one place.
• Control spending by having all users under one account and on the
right plan with features that meet your needs.
Should all users have permissions to do anything
and everything?
If you’re working in a regulated industry or your organization has clear
communications policies, it makes sense to maintain tighter control over,
and have visibility into, external messaging and meeting processes.
• Avoid “over-granting” permissions for the sake of flexibility
or convenience.
• Ensure consistency and compliance by limiting some user capabilities,
such as who can set up Round Robin and co-hosted Event Types,
or who can create, edit, and delete Workflows (sending reminders,
sharing content, follow-up notes, etc).

https://pages.calendly.com/rs/482-NMZ-854/images/scheduling-automation-teams.p1d2f/30/25, 3:12 AM
• Update user roles/groups and control visibility into data to maintain
customizations for certain departments and any necessary
confidentiality between different teams.
Are you integrating with other tools to increase
efficiency and maintain accurate data?
Get more ROI from your existing tech with integrations that keep reps
working where you want them, and prevent inaccuracies between records
so you can trust your data.
For example: Directly integrate with Salesforce and easily customize for
your needs with Calendly’s pre-built functionality, including:
• Eliminate manual data entry: Any meeting booked with Calendly
is logged in the right customer record, or a new lead and event is
created. And you can capture canceled events.
• Ensure records are accurate: The SFDC ID can be carried in a Calendly
link and carried back across to SFDC to check records.
• Customize to use at scale across your organization: Create filters to
only process certain record types. For instance, if your HR/recruiting
team uses Calendly, they don’t need a new SFDC record created for
each candidate they interview.
• Optimize marketing automation: When someone fills out a website
form, they’re assigned to a rep based on your logic, and receive an
automated email with the rep’s Calendly link.
• Route known leads and customers: Send existing leads or customers
directly to their account owner’s booking page. (This happens
behind the scenes using a Salesforce ownership lookup — no manual
reassignment needed.)
Set up similar workflows with other CRM tools, as Calendly is easily
customized for your needs.
You can also leverage web browser and LinkedIn extensions so your users
can embed suggested times in emails for one-click booking, or quickly
share scheduling links anywhere they engage with prospects.

How is Calendly different?
Calendly is the first platform to automate both inbound and outbound
revenue generation for thousands of revenue teams — sales, marketing,
and customer success — looking to increase revenue, accelerate pipeline,
and improve customer retention all along the customer lifecycle.
Calendly has literally increased the velocity of the
conversations we are scheduling — how quickly we are able
to get in contact with partners — because the scheduling
aspect and the friction are completely resolved.”
Winta Habteslassie, Partnerships Manager, Square
Like Winta, millions of sales and customer success pros email and send
LinkedIn messages with Calendly scheduling links to book appointments …
but that’s only one step in the meeting lifecycle.
Calendly is trusted by not only revenue teams, but also recruiting, product
management, and executive teams. In other words, Calendly is likely used
by every department in your company, which makes consolidating on one
platform appealing and easy. In addition, Calendly is built with privacy
and security features such as SSO and SCIM — features required by IT
colleagues in companies of all sizes.
Unlike conventional online calendar companies’ approaches to
scheduling tools that focus on one-to-one booking, Calendly offers
scheduling automation for your whole revenue team (from Round Robin
distribution and collective scheduling to admin-powered standardization
of how Calendly is used team-wide), messaging and notifications
all along the customer lifecycle (Workflows), and security and
privacy features for Enterprises.

including scheduling tools for inbound demand generation (website
scheduling and lead routing), team-based scheduling (collective events
with coworkers, Meeting Polls), and email reminders and notification
(Workflows).
Calendly is the most complete scheduling automation platform on the
market for revenue teams (and every team). Thousands of sales, marketing,
and customer success professionals use Calendly today — some for
inbound marketing, and many for outbound.
By implementing Calendly in both your inbound and outbound marketing
efforts, revenue teams can increase revenue, accelerate pipeline, and
improve customer retention.

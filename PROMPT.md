# AI Agent Commands

**One-three word commands to start work**

---

## Commands & Routing

**Type the command, then read the specified file:**

| Command | Read This File | What It Does |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| `Start` | `AGENTS.json` (or `AGENTS.md`) | Begin work on current task |
| `Work` | `AGENTS.json` (or `AGENTS.md`) | Same as Start |
| `Task` | `AGENTS.json` (or `AGENTS.md`) | Work on current task |
| `Review` | `AGENTS.json` (or `AGENTS.md`) | Review/create PR |
| `Security` | `AGENTS.json` (or `AGENTS.md`) | Security-related work |
| `Help` | `AGENTS.json` (or `AGENTS.md`) | Get guidance |

**Prefer JSON:** Models parse `AGENTS.json` more reliably. Use `AGENTS.md` as human-readable fallback.

## Usage

**Example:**

```
Start
```

**Then read:** `AGENTS.md` (root entry point)

**The entry point (`AGENTS.md`) will guide you through everything:**
- Your role
- What to read next
- Workflow steps
- Decision trees

---

**That's it!** The documents are self-guiding. No long prompts needed.

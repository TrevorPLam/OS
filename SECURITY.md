# Security Policy

Security and privacy are foundational to ConsultantPro. Please handle potential vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Preferred:** Use your hosting platform's private security reporting workflow (e.g., GitHub Security Advisories).
- **If private reporting is unavailable:** Contact the project maintainers directly and avoid public disclosure until a fix is available.

## What to Include

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected versions or commits
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

## Response Expectations

The team will triage reports as quickly as possible, prioritize based on severity, and coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline.

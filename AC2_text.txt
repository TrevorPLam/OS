https://central.kiwischools.co.nz/assets/newsletter/kiwischools.co.nz-1599086952275.pdf

People experience your company in different ways. They come from various locations:
your website, social media, online search results, advertisements, trade shows,
networking events… anywhere your brand lives is a potential entry point for new
contacts.
It’s critical to take some time to focus on creating the ideal Customer Experience for all
of your contacts. Thinking holistically about the continuous journeys your contacts will
experience with your business will help you better understand what the most relevant
content is for each of your audiences, making it easier to create a natural relationship.

https://central.kiwischools.co.nz/assets/newsletter/kiwischools.co.nz-1599086952275.pdf

During the Awareness stage, you want to:
-

Identify your most effective channels for capturing leads
Better understand and target different customer personas
Understand SEO and how you fit into your leads’ research stage

During the Consideration stage, you want to:
-

Track what educational content your leads engage with
Understand your lead’s needs on a deeper level
Create a strategy for re-engaging cold leads

During the Decision stage, you want to:
-

Create a sales/marketing funnel to track leads
Prioritize qualified leads for targeted follow up
Understand when and why contacts convert or fall off in the customer experience map

During the Growth stage, you want to:
-

Create a customer onboarding journey
Track customer adoption through activity or defined milestones
Upsell and cross-sell customers at the right time

During the Advocacy stage, you want to:
-

Identify top customers and engage with them
Track and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty
Better understand the impact of brand advocacy efforts

Review
The Customer Experience Map can take many forms, and follow many paths. You are
creating a marketing and sales system that will:
●
●
●
●
●

Introduce your brand to new prospects (Awareness)
Tell them more about what you have available (Consideration)
Encourage them to buy (Decision)
Keep them engaged and wanting more (Growth)
Turn them into Advocates

The ​Advocates​ of your brand are then a new path of ​Awareness.​ The customer
experience grows and changes, but creating a continuum is key.

Segmentation

12/30/25, 3 08 AM
https://central.kiwischools.co.nz/assets/newsletter/kiwischools.co.nz-1599086952275.pdf

Segmentation means grouping your contacts by attributes or actions. In
ActiveCampaign, segmentation uses a combination of lists, tags, and fields, as well as
contact behaviors that can be tracked within emails or on your website.
— Attributes:​ quality or feature of a contact
‒ Examples: interests, budget, contact location
— Actions:​ customer behavior you can track
‒ Examples: opened campaign, clicked link, visited page
Segmentation helps you send the right message, to the right person, at the right time.

Segments as Diagrams
Creating your perfect audience gets easier when you think about how to set up your
system beforehand.
Now that you’ve got it down, let’s make some diagrams of the types of audiences you
can create.

Example

Diagram Your Segments
When you properly set up your software, it simplifies the creation of your perfect
audience. The Segment Builder will help you find that target.
Remember:​ segments are a combination of attributes and actions for your contacts.
Now that you got it down, let’s diagram the types of audiences you can create.

Segment Builder
The ​segment builder​ appears throughout the entire ActiveCampaign platform; any time
you have to make a decision about your audience, or your process flow, you’ll end up
working with the Segment Builder.
If you collect data, you can use the Segment Builder to sort your contacts with that
data. You can use the ​Segment Builder​ to create a dynamic, always-updating version
of venn diagrams for your perfect audience.
Think of some combinations of Lists, Tags, and Fields for your audience. Write them
below, along with the type of message you’d send to that segment.

Based on your plan level and integrations set up, you may see
different options in the segment builder!

Contact Management
You want your ActiveCampaign contacts to be as organized as possible.
We recommend using a small number of ​lists​, as many ​tags​ as you need, and the
custom fields​ that make sense for your business.
Note:
— A contact is represented by an email address.
— An active contact is subscribed to at least one list.

Contact Management Overview
— Lists​ are the largest bucket of contacts. They should encompass different
communication types or information. Many businesses only use one list, a
Master​ or ​All Contacts​ list.
‒ Example lists: Customers, Prospects, Vendors, Board Members
— Tags​ are used to denote interests, engagement, or anything else you may want
to act on in the future.
‒ Example tags: Engaged, Disengaged, Interested in [Product Type],
Member
— Fields​ include the standard Name, Email, Phone Number. ​Custom Fields​ are
pieces of information you’d like to collect for all contacts; they are also used to
personalize Forms.
‒ Example custom fields: Birthday, Business Address, Policy Number

Lists
Lists are the best way to organize broad groups of contacts.
Common reasons for using multiple lists: Message frequency, supporting different
languages, two different companies communicating from one account

Tags
You can use Tags to denote interests, engagement, behaviors, promotional activity…
the sky’s the limit! What types of tags are you using right now? What type might you
want to use? How are they organized?

Tag Name:​ Recent Activity
Purpose of tag:​ Tag anyone who’s interacted with
materials in the last 7 days
(Optional) Tag Group:​ Engagement Group

Fields & Custom Fields
Custom fields let you personalize your ActiveCampaign Contacts on an individual level.
If you need a piece of information that’s specific to each contact on your list, a custom
field is the way to go.
You can also use custom fields in Forms, and they are particularly useful when asking
questions and gauging interests.

Custom Field Types
Text input:​ A short text field

Text area:​ A longer text box, good for
comments/feedback

Drop-down menu:​ Create options to select
from a list; best used for 10+ choices

Multi-selection list:​ Select as many options
from the list as needed

Radio button:​ Select one option from a list

Check boxes: ​Select one-or-many options
from a list

Hidden fields:​ Invisible to contacts, and used to assign information to a contact

Forms
Forms​ are a great way to collect information about your contacts. How? You ask them
for what you need!
Using a combination of Fields and Custom Fields, you can ask your contacts for any
important information you’d like to collect, including their interests and preferences.
The key is to create a form that clearly asks for needed information, explains why that
information is necessary, and sets expectations about how frequently you’ll be
reaching out in the future.

Form Best Practices
● Form Actions are one of the first things you should select. What happens when a
contact submits your form? You can choose to subscribe contacts to a list, add a
tag, and other actions.
● By default, all forms have double opt-in turned on. Double opt-in sends an email
confirmation when someone completes your form, asking them to click to
confirm their subscription. Before changing this setting, ​carefully consider the
way you’re using your form.
● Don’t forget to say thank you! Everyone who submits your form will see a default
thank you, but ​you can configure it​ to redirect to a URL.

Form Use Cases
Forms are great for more than just a newsletter! Use cases include:
● Downloadable resource — Use forms as a gate for a white paper or other free
download
● Consultation request
● Software Demo
● Quizzes
● Contact preferences

People using your form are actively engaging with you.
Make the most out of the moment!

Planning Your Forms
Forms should fit into your customer experience seamlessly. Use this worksheet to
clarify the goals of your existing forms, or forms you’d like to create.
Don’t forget — forms are your opportunity to create Custom Fields and ask for input.
Are your contacts interested in a particular product line? Do they want to know about
live events, or product updates?

Examples
Name of Form:​ Newsletter Opt-In
Part of customer experience map:​ Awareness
Location of Form:​ Banner across the bottom of entire site
Information requested:​ Full Name, Email Address
Form Action:​ Subscribe to primary list, add Newsletter tag
Thank You Page:​ Send to a thank you URL on main site with additional contact information
Double Opt-In?:​ Yes

Campaigns
Campaigns are emails, and they’re a vital part of your marketing strategy. Email still
boasts the highest Return on Investment (ROI) of any digital marketing channel.
Campaigns can be sent from the Campaign section of the platform, or from within
Automations. (That’s coming up next!)

Campaign Best Practices
Marketing has grown up past the days of sending all of your emails to your entire list.
This is where you start using your segmentation power to send the right message to
the right people.
There are ​several types of campaigns​ that you can send.
— Standard:​ Simple broadcast email, sent immediately or scheduled
— Automated:​ Redirects you to the Automation builder, so you can create an
automation
— Auto Responder:​ Sends a message immediately after someone joins your list
— Split Testing:​ Send multiple versions of your campaigns to see which performs
best
— RSS Triggered:​ Triggered by an update to your RSS feed
— Date Based:​ Sent based on a date field on your contact’s record - for example, a
birthday or customer anniversary
After you select the type of campaign you would like to send, you can choose who to
send it to (a list and/or segment). Check out the ​campaign walkthrough​ for the entire
process.

Content Blocks
The ​Email Designer​ has several types of drag-and-drop content blocks that you can
use to create your emails.
— Text:​ add copy
— Image:​ add images
— Button:​ use buttons to create a prominent call to action (CTA)
— Video:​ link to a video on YouTube or Vimeo
— Line break:​ design element, line between content
— Spacer:​ design element, space between content
— Social:​ add your social media follow pages
— HTML:​ add custom HTML code

Split Test Proposal
In marketing, you should always be testing. In email marketing specifically, you should be doing
this through split testing. In this sheet you’re going to come up with a split test for your business
that you can create in campaigns!

1. Pull up your customer experience map homework and pick a place in your map where
you will be sending an email with a specific goal in mind. Mark down your email and
goal below.
What is the internal name of the email?​ _________________________________
Ex. - Sign up for free trial email

What is the goal of the email?: ​_______________________________________
Ex. - to get more newsletter prospects to sign up for a trial

2. Identify the most important key performance indicator (primary KPI) for this test.
What’s the primary KPI? : ​__________________________________________
Ex. - % of leads that start a trial

How long will you give them to do the goal after the email has been sent? : ​________
Ex. - 7 days from the email being sent

3. Please identify your KPIs that you categorize as secondary in importance for this test.
Secondary KPIs: ​________________________________________________
________________________________________________
Ex. - email open rate, email click-through rate, average days to trial

Now that you have established your goal, it’s time to use split testing to achieve
it. The3 08 AM

testable aspects of email are limitless! You can test different subject lines, content,
calls to action, ect. ​The most important element to remember is to only change one
variable per email in a split test.​ ​This way you’ll know exactly why one change
worked over another.
NOTE: Split tests are not limited to two emails per test, you can send out up to five
emails with one variable changed in each one.
What element do you want to change? ​_________________________________
Ex. - subject line, text block wording, images, featured products, call to action

List what specifically will change about each email below. You need to test at least two
emails and can go up to five.
1. _______________________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________________
4. _______________________________________________________
5. _______________________________________________________
Ex. - if you are testing different calls to action after a particular purchase, you could suggest a
different product across 5 different versions

When are you planning on sending this test? ​_____________________________
Great work! Now you can go into campaigns and start building this out!

Automations
You made it! Automations!
Automation is the engine that drives your marketing and sales processes within
ActiveCampaign, and we can’t wait to dig in.
The goal of automations is to create paths, processes, and journeys — both internal
and external. Think about your business processes. How can they translate to an
automation? Here are some scenarios you may already be thinking about.
— When someone signs up for your newsletter, they enter a drip nurture sequence
where you tell them more about your business and the latest news. You will
follow up based on what they open and what they click on. You want to stop
sending them emails if they aren’t opening them, or if they become a customer.
— When someone purchases something from your ecommerce store, you want to
send them a thank you and direct them to a site to submit a product review. You
will ask them for a review a few times, perhaps with a coupon code for future
purchases. If they submit a review, you want to stop asking them for reviews.
— Think outside the email! You want to direct prospects to a Facebook custom
audience until they purchase. Also, you want to leverage site messages to
collect additional information from contacts with form links, and more.

Anatomy of an Automation
Automations are made up of two basic parts:
— Start Triggers​: ​The “front door” to your automation, start triggers determine the
action that starts a contact down a path.
— Actions​:​ Actions make up everything else! You can send campaigns to contacts,
send internal emails to your team, use conditional statements to create multiple
paths based on behaviors such as email opens and link clicks. You can also add
wait steps, create Deals in the CRM, and take other actions that help you truly
create a personalized journey for every contact that flows through your
automations.

Automation Best Practices
1. Like any good story, every automation path should have a beginning, a middle,
and an end.
2. Break your automations up into smaller, more manageable pieces. (Hot tip: you
can send contacts to new automations as they complete their current journey!)
3. Automate the repetitive, so you can focus on the impactful.
4. Find the right blend of automation and human touch for your business, to find
success with your automation journeys.

Automation Basics
Welcome Series:​ Send a small welcome series to new contacts as soon as they are
added to your list. After a few days, check to see if they opened the welcome email. If
so, send them a follow-up message with a little more depth. If not, send them a
reworking of the welcome email with a new subject line and slightly different
messaging.

CX Automation
Now, let’s bring all of this together and really dig into Customer Experience Automation
— also known as CX Automation. You want to use automation to market smarter;
automation has become the norm in the industry, and it’s time to take a different
approach.
CX Automation is all about sending the right message, to the right person, at the right
time.

The 6 Principles of CX Automation
1. Every person should get a unique experience.​ People are different, and
automation should give each person exactly what they need.
2. Don’t start with a blank slate.​ Automations should build themselves, so you
don’t need to build them one at a time.
3. The perfect experience changes over time.​ Automations should update
themselves, to save you the work of maintaining complex, powerful
automations.
4. You know your business—you should still be in control.​ Your business is
yours. Even as automation gets smarter, you still need to be the one who holds
the reins.
5. Ideal experiences change from business to business.​ As your business
changes, so should your automations, based on the metrics that matter to
you—not just generic clicks and opens.
6. It’s not just messaging—it’s everything that affects your customers.
Automation controls more than messages—it manages everything (including
your own team) that will affect the customer experience.

CX Automations to Import
CXA Marketing
Webinar Reminder Series:​ Run a lead-in campaign to your upcoming event, as well as
a follow-up when the event is done. This is great for letting your contacts know more
about the event they are attending and then allows them to leave testimonials and
reviews based on their experience. Before importing, build a date based custom field
for the event date.
Note before you import!​ You need a Date-Based Custom Field for this automation.

CXA Support
Customer Service Follow-up:​ If a contact is given the tag "Customer service follow-up," a
follow-up email is sent after one day. If the customer clicks the "not resolved" link, it will tell
your support team to reach out to them, and redirect the contact to a form to collect more
information. If they click the "resolved" link, it will remove the tag. You could apply the
"Customer service follow-up" tag using ActiveCampaign’s Conversations tool or by integrating
with your help desk app.

Part 1 - Engagement Tagging/Part 2 - Engagement Tagging: ​Many of your marketing
decisions can be made based on the last time your contacts engaged with your
marketing materials. You have access to three recipes that will help you track when
people engage, reach out to re-engage, and try to save contacts one final time before
unsubscribing them to your list.

Deals CRM
What’s a CRM?
A CRM is a Customer Relationship Manager; the ActiveCampaign CRM is named Deals.
A CRM is a tool for:
● Helping your teams stay on top of what’s next for each lead and customer along
every step of their journeys
● Managing interactions with your prospects and customers
● Tracking a prospect/customer’s progress through a particular process, or story
they qualified for
● Measuring the success of your various team’s performance
Note: The Deals CRM is available on the Plus Plan and above.
Sure, you can track sales funnels and opportunities. But, you can also use Deals to
create a visualization of any process that has steps. Examples include:
— New customer onboarding
— Internal employee onboarding
— Hiring funnels
— Shipping and order fulfillment
— Any process you’d like to keep track of, that has stages!
The Deals CRM looks like this:

Pipelines
A pipeline is a defined set of stages for tracking a process. You may have one sales
process for selling ads, one for selling a subscription service, or one for following up
with existing customers to try to upsell them. You may also have processes for
managing your relationships post-sale that you can track with pipelines.

Stages
Stages represent the steps included in your pipeline. In the Deals CRM, stages are
presented in columns and move from left to right. Any deal you create should start in
the left column and can be dragged and automated to other columns as it progresses.

Deals
A deal in a pipeline contains information pertaining to a potential sale or
opportunity—it is where you develop your sales process and get your leads to take
action. Deals move from one stage to the next either manually or via automation and
can be assigned a particular owner depending on the stage/pipeline.

Tasks
A task is a to-do item for your deal. This can include lunch, a call, an email, or a
meeting. A deal owner can view their deals by stage or by task due date. You can also
export tasks to a deal owner’s calendar in settings.

Scoring
Why is lead scoring valuable?
All leads and customers were not created equally. Oftentimes, you need to get a good
gauge on the different thresholds of engagement our contacts have with each other.
These thresholds can be created through lead scoring.

What is lead scoring?
Scores, like in any game, only make sense if you have rules and goals; lead scoring is
no different. ActiveCampaign’s lead scoring capabilities are incredibly flexible,
empowering marketers to add and subtract points to their contacts based on actions or
inaction. But before you get started assigning points, you have to determine what’s
most important to you.
The purpose of lead scoring is to track contacts’ engagements, creating a temperature
gauge by which to plan future messaging and outreach. Think of lead scoring as a
gamification of your marketing process. The points don’t matter until you create the
rules and objectives; you can’t win without a plan!

As is the theme across this whole course, Customer Experience Automation applies to
everything you do — including the relationships you manage though Deals and scoring.
Let's dive into some recipes you might use with these features!
CXA Marketing
Scoring Based Facebook Audience Flow:​ Move your contacts through different
Facebook Custom Audiences based on a score, such as engagement or total
purchases. ​Before importing, connect your Facebook integration in Settings.

CXA Sales
Travel - Private Tour Booking:​ This example is designed with travel companies in
mind but makes sense for any relationship-based businesses that need to notify a
sales representative when a new lead comes in. This workflow sends a message to
your team in their inbox and creates a task for them to call in our CRM. If the call
doesn’t happen in three days, they will be reminded to call via task again.
Before importing, build a stage in your pipeline for contacts for new leads!

CXA Operations

Adjust Expected Close Date:​ Circumstances change and expectations should change
accordingly. Adjust your expected close date on a deal when they move between
stages using the Math action. Specifically, when they regress in stages, you can add
more days. You can take the inverse approach as well by subtracting days based on
high engagement. Feel free to make this as general or specific as you want to.
Before importing, build a custom date deal field for “Expected Close Date.”

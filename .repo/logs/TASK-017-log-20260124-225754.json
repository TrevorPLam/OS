  "intent": "Refactor CRM pages to use React Query error states",
  "plan": [
    "Add React Query loading/error state handling for CRM pages",
    "Replace console error logging with user-facing error messages",
    "Update task tracking files to mark TASK-017 complete and promote the next task",
    "Record trace and agent logs with verification evidence"
  ],
  "actions": [
    "Added loading and error states to Deals, Prospects, PipelineKanban, PipelineAnalytics, and Leads pages",
    "Introduced action-level error messages for create/update/delete flows",
    "Moved TASK-017 to the archive and promoted TASK-018 to TODO"

  "evidence": [
    "make lint (frontend lint warnings only; backend lint pass)",
    "Screenshot captured: artifacts/crm-deals-error-handling.png"
  ],
  "decisions": [
    "Used existing React Query hook errors for user-facing messaging instead of console logging"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Error messaging depends on existing CSS styles for .error; verify design consistency"
  ],
  "follow_ups": [
    "Address existing ESLint warnings when working on TASK-018"
  ],
  "reasoning_summary": "CRM pages already used React Query for data access, so the refactor focused on exposing loading and error states to users and removing console-only error handling. Task tracking files were updated to mark the work complete and continue the backlog workflow.",
  "notes": "No secrets. No private data. No raw chain-of-thought."

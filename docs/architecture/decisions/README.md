# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records document significant architectural decisions.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs document:
- **Context** - Why the decision was needed
- **Decision** - What was decided
- **Consequences** - Impact and trade-offs

## ADR Process

1. **Identify Need** - Decision required
2. **Create ADR** - Use template from `.repo/templates/ADR_TEMPLATE.md`
3. **Review** - Get approval if needed
4. **Document** - Store in this directory
5. **Reference** - Link from relevant code/docs

## When to Create an ADR

Create ADR when:
- Crossing module boundaries (Principle 23)
- Making significant architectural changes
- Introducing new technologies
- Changing core patterns
- Making decisions with long-term impact

## ADR Template

See `.repo/templates/ADR_TEMPLATE.md` for the standard ADR format.

> - explains why the old rule is insufficient,
> - includes migration/transition steps,
> - includes a rollback plan if applicable."

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:
- ✅ Affect system architecture or design patterns
- ✅ Change or amend the Coding Constitution
- ✅ Introduce new technologies or frameworks
- ✅ Modify data models or database schema patterns

Don't create ADRs for:
- ❌ Routine bug fixes
- ❌ Minor refactoring
- ❌ Code style preferences

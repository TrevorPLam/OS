# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

We use ADRs to record architectural decisions that impact the system’s long-term behavior, security, scalability, or team workflows.

## When to write an ADR

- You are choosing between significant alternatives.
- You are introducing a new dependency, service, or framework.
- You are changing a core domain model, data flow, or security boundary.

## How to add an ADR

1. Copy `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`.
2. Increment the ADR number.
3. Fill out the template and link to relevant PRs or issues.

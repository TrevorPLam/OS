# 0001 - Record architecture decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a lightweight, reviewable way to capture and communicate architectural decisions so future changes remain consistent and auditable.

## Decision

Adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `docs/05-decisions/adr/` using a consistent template.

## Consequences

- Architectural intent is explicit and discoverable.
- Significant decisions require minimal but consistent documentation.
- The decision log becomes part of the code review process.

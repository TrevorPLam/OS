# Decision Log (ADR-lite)

This file records major architecture and product decisions that affect invariants, data models, and implementation boundaries.

Purpose:
- Make it explicit what is decided vs still open
- Prevent re-litigating decisions in code review
- Give reviewers a clear map of constraints and tradeoffs

Rules:
1. Every decision must link to the spec sections it affects.
2. Every “Accepted” decision must be reflected in SYSTEM_SPEC.md (or explicitly marked “Deferred” with a target).
3. If a decision is open, it belongs in OPEN_QUESTIONS.md (with options + consequences).
4. Deprecated decisions stay here with a clear replacement link.

Decision status values:
- Proposed
- Accepted
- Deprecated

## Decisions

## ADR-0001: Tenancy model is schema-per-tenant
Status: **Deprecated (Superseded by ADR-0010)**  
Date: 2025-12-28  
Owners: Platform  
Related: ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md; SYSTEM_SPEC.md (Tenancy); DB_SCHEMA_AND_MIGRATIONS.md

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED**: This ADR has been superseded by ADR-0010. The actual tenancy model is firm-scoped row-level isolation, not schema-per-tenant. See ADR-0010 for the canonical decision.

Context  
- Regulated, audit-sensitive workflows require strong tenant isolation.
- We want predictable data boundaries and reduced blast radius.

Decision  
- ~~Each firm (tenant) is isolated using a dedicated database schema.~~
- **ACTUAL**: Each firm is isolated using row-level scoping with `firm` ForeignKey on all models.
- ~~Shared/global tables (if any) are explicitly separated and minimized.~~

Consequences  
Positive:
- Strong isolation, simpler compliance posture, clearer operational boundaries.
- Easier to reason about tenant-scoped migrations and audits.
Negative / tradeoffs:
- More complex provisioning, migrations, and operational tooling.
- Cross-tenant analytics require explicit aggregation patterns.

Alternatives considered  
- Row-level tenancy in shared schema: rejected due to higher accidental exposure risk and more complex permission/query enforcement.
- Separate database per tenant: rejected for operational overhead at SMB scale (may be reconsidered for large tenants later).

Spec impact  
- SYSTEM_SPEC.md: Tenancy + isolation invariants  
- DB_SCHEMA_AND_MIGRATIONS.md: provisioning + migration runner  
- OBSERVABILITY_AND_SRE.md: per-tenant monitoring strategy

## ADR-0002: Canonical core object graph
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-12-28  
Owners: Platform + Product  
Related: ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md; SYSTEM_SPEC.md; DOMAIN_MODEL.md

Context  
- CRM, intake, delivery, documents, and billing often drift into disconnected “modules.”
- A stable object graph enables consistent permissions, auditability, and linking.

Decision  
- The canonical core object graph is:
  - Account / Contact / Engagement / EngagementLine / WorkItem
- Cross-domain artifacts (documents, conversations, appointments, invoices) attach through explicit associations to this graph.

Consequences  
Positive:
- Consistent linking, permission evaluation, and audit references.
- Reduces “orphan” artifacts and shadow workflows.
Negative / tradeoffs:
- Requires discipline to prevent ad-hoc “shortcut” entities that bypass the graph.

Alternatives considered  
- Separate module-specific primary objects: rejected due to broken cross-module workflows and duplicated identity.

Spec impact  
- SYSTEM_SPEC.md: domain boundaries and invariants  
- DOMAIN_MODEL.md: entity definitions and relationships  
- PERMISSIONS_MODEL.md: evaluation anchors

---

## ADR-0003: Intake, pricing, and engagements fold into CRM (not separate modules)
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-12-28  
Owners: Product + Platform  
Related: SYSTEM_SPEC.md; DOMAIN_MODEL.md; PRICING_ENGINE_SPEC.md

Context  
- Professional services workflows require a coherent lifecycle from lead → scoped work → delivery.
- Separating intake/pricing into standalone modules creates handoff errors and duplicated identity.

Decision  
- Intake, qualification, and pricing are CRM-adjacent flows operating on the same Account/Contact and producing Engagement drafts and QuoteVersions.
- Engagement activation is the explicit transition that “starts delivery.”

Consequences  
Positive:
- Fewer handoff seams; clearer lifecycle.
- Pricing snapshots (QuoteVersion) attach to Engagement/EngagementLine cleanly.
Negative / tradeoffs:
- CRM becomes more “systems-of-record” than a simple sales tracker.

Alternatives considered  
- Separate intake/quoting app: rejected due to duplication and brittle syncing.

Spec impact  
- SYSTEM_SPEC.md: lifecycle invariants and transitions  
- PRICING_ENGINE_SPEC.md: quote snapshotting rules  
- DOMAIN_MODEL.md: Engagement/Quote/Activation states

---

## ADR-0004: Pricing rules are versioned JSON with trace output
Status: Proposed  
Date: 2025-12-28  
Owners: Platform  
Related: PRICING_ENGINE_SPEC.md; SYSTEM_SPEC.md

Context  
- Pricing must be explainable, auditable, and snapshot-able at the time of agreement.
- Non-coders must be able to evolve pricing without redeploying core systems (within guardrails).

Decision  
- Pricing rules are defined as a versioned JSON schema.
- Evaluator produces (a) outputs and (b) a detailed trace.
- Accepted quotes create immutable QuoteVersions.

Consequences  
Positive:
- Auditable, reproducible pricing results.
- Enables rule snapshotting and comparisons across time.
Negative / tradeoffs:
- Requires strong schema validation and tooling to prevent rule drift.
- Debugging requires trace UX and stable evaluation context.

Alternatives considered  
- Code-based pricing logic only: rejected due to limited agility and harder audit reproducibility.
- Spreadsheet-first pricing: rejected as a primary engine due to brittle versioning and weak audit semantics (can exist as an authoring surface only).

Spec impact  
- PRICING_ENGINE_SPEC.md: schema + evaluation context + trace  
- DOMAIN_MODEL.md: Quote/QuoteVersion  
- API_CONTRACTS.md: pricing endpoints + trace retrieval

---

## ADR-0005: Dual workflow model naming and semantics
Status: Proposed  
Date: 2025-12-28  
Owners: Product + Platform  
Related: DELIVERY_TEMPLATES_SPEC.md; ORCHESTRATION_ENGINE_SPEC.md; SYSTEM_SPEC.md

Context  
- The platform needs both:
  1) human-facing delivery plans (templates into WorkItems), and
  2) machine-enforced orchestration (steps, retries, DLQ).
- Conflating these creates confusion and hard-to-debug “automation magic.”

Decision  
- Delivery Templates define the WorkItem plan (DAG of deliverables/tasks).
- Orchestration defines execution control (step workflows, retries, compensation).
- Naming must reflect the distinction, and cross-links must be explicit.

Consequences  
Positive:
- Clear separation of intent (delivery plan) vs mechanism (execution engine).
Negative / tradeoffs:
- More concepts to teach; requires good docs and UI labeling.

Alternatives considered  
- Single “workflow engine” for everything: rejected due to poor clarity and higher blast radius for changes.

Spec impact  
- DELIVERY_TEMPLATES_SPEC.md and ORCHESTRATION_ENGINE_SPEC.md  
- SYSTEM_SPEC.md: boundaries and invariants

---

## ADR-0006: Identity decoupling model (staff vs portal contacts)
Status: Proposed  
Date: 2025-12-28  
Owners: Platform  
Related: PERMISSIONS_MODEL.md; SYSTEM_SPEC.md; CLIENT_PORTAL_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md

Context  
- Professional-services organizations need strict separation between internal users and external client contacts.
- Portal contacts may belong to multiple Accounts and must have scoped access.

Decision  
- Staff identity is internal RBAC.
- Portal identity is contact-scoped with explicit Account associations and permission scopes.
- “Account switcher” is supported when a portal identity is linked to multiple Accounts.

Consequences  
Positive:
- Least-privilege defaults and clearer external access control.
Negative / tradeoffs:
- More complex permission evaluation and UI gating.

Alternatives considered  
- Treat portal users as standard users with limited roles: rejected due to weaker separation and higher risk of accidental privilege escalation.

Spec impact  
- PERMISSIONS_MODEL.md: portal scopes and evaluation rules  
- DOMAIN_MODEL.md: Contact ↔ portal identity mapping  
- SECURITY_MODEL.md: threat model for portal access

## ADR-0007: Recurrence generation uses dedupe constraints + idempotent workers
Status: Proposed  
Date: 2025-12-28  
Owners: Platform  
Related: RECURRENCE_ENGINE_SPEC.md; WORKERS_AND_QUEUES.md

Context  
- Recurring work (monthly close, quarterly filings, etc.) is a core professional-services pattern.
- DST/timezone behavior and retries commonly cause duplicate work creation.

Decision  
- Introduce a RecurrenceGeneration table with strict uniqueness constraints for (template, period, anchor, tenant).
- Workers must be idempotent and use advisory locks / SKIP LOCKED patterns where appropriate.
- Pause/resume/cancel semantics must not duplicate already-instantiated work.

Consequences  
Positive:
- Prevents duplicates under retries and concurrent workers.
- Enables traceability for “why did this get generated?”
Negative / tradeoffs:
- Requires careful period definition rules and explicit timezone policy.

Alternatives considered  
- Generate “on read” only: rejected due to unpredictability and poor auditability.
- Cron-style triggers without dedupe: rejected due to duplicate risk.

Spec impact  
- RECURRENCE_ENGINE_SPEC.md: period rules + dedupe + algorithm  
- WORKERS_AND_QUEUES.md: job concurrency and locking

---

## ADR-0008: Document versioning + locking semantics
Status: Proposed  
Date: 2025-12-28  
Owners: Platform  
Related: DOCUMENTS_AND_STORAGE_SPEC.md; PERMISSIONS_MODEL.md

Context  
- Audit-sensitive workflows require defensible document history.
- Teams need guardrails against silent overwrites and uncontrolled sharing.

Decision  
- Documents are versioned, and selected document types support explicit locking.
- Access is through signed URLs with policy enforcement.
- Document access must be logged (who/when/what).

Consequences  
Positive:
- Clear provenance and defensibility of artifacts.
Negative / tradeoffs:
- More complexity in upload/edit flows and conflict resolution UX.

Alternatives considered  
- Simple file storage with last-write-wins: rejected due to audit and collaboration risks.

Spec impact  
- DOCUMENTS_AND_STORAGE_SPEC.md: versioning, locking, signed URL policies, logging  
- PERMISSIONS_MODEL.md: document permission evaluation

---

## ADR-0009: Billing is ledger-first (invoices, payments, retainers as entries)
Status: Proposed  
Date: 2025-12-28  
Owners: Platform + Finance domain  
Related: BILLING_LEDGER_SPEC.md; SYSTEM_SPEC.md

Context  
- Billing must be explainable and auditable.
- Retainers and allocations create edge cases that “invoice-only” models mishandle.

Decision  
- Model all billing movements as ledger entries (invoice, payment, retainer credits, allocations).
- Reports (AR, retainer balance, earned revenue) derive from entries.
- Idempotency requirements apply to posting operations.

Consequences  
Positive:
- Strong auditability; clear reconciliation.
Negative / tradeoffs:
- Requires careful allocation constraints and reporting correctness.

Alternatives considered  
- Invoice-only model with computed balances: rejected due to audit weakness and retainer complexity.

Spec impact  
- BILLING_LEDGER_SPEC.md: entry types, allocations, constraints, reports  
- EDGE_CASES_CATALOG.md: idempotency and allocation edge cases

---

## ADR-0010: Communications include native chat plus email ingestion
Status: Proposed
Date: 2025-12-28
Owners: Product + Platform
Related: EMAIL_INGESTION_SPEC.md; (future) COMMUNICATIONS_SPEC.md; DOCUMENTS_AND_STORAGE_SPEC.md

Context
- Firms need communication in context with work, and clients expect portal messaging.
- Email remains a reality; attachments must become governed artifacts.

Decision
- Provide native conversation threads (staff↔staff, staff↔client) plus email ingestion that stores emails/attachments as artifacts with mapping suggestions and audit.
- Email ingestion does not become the authoritative "conversation model"; it is an ingestion source feeding governed artifacts.

Consequences
Positive:
- Reduces shadow communication and scattered attachments.
Negative / tradeoffs:
- Requires strong threading/staleness heuristics and correction workflows.

Alternatives considered
- "Email only" communications: rejected due to poor in-context collaboration and portal UX.
- "Chat only" with no email integration: rejected as unrealistic for firm operations.

Spec impact
- EMAIL_INGESTION_SPEC.md: mapping, staleness, correction and audit
- DOCUMENTS_AND_STORAGE_SPEC.md: attachment artifact handling
- COMMUNICATIONS_SPEC.md: thread model and permissions (to be created)

## ADR-0011: Immutability enforcement for legal and billing records
Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-12-29
Owners: Platform
Related: SYSTEM_SPEC.md; BILLING_LEDGER_SPEC.md; DOMAIN_MODEL.md

Context
- Signed contracts and invoiced time entries are legal evidence and billing sources of truth.
- Post-signature modifications to contracts or post-invoicing edits to time entries create audit gaps and potential disputes.
- Platform must prevent accidental or malicious tampering with finalized business records.

Decision
- Enforce model-level immutability constraints for critical business records:
  1. **Signed Contracts**: Once `signed_date` and `signed_by` are set, they cannot be modified
  2. **Proposal Amount Freeze**: Once a proposal has an associated signed contract, its `total_value` cannot be changed
  3. **Invoiced Time Entries**: Once a time entry is marked as `invoiced=True`, core fields (hours, rate, date) are locked

Consequences
Positive:
- Prevents data integrity violations that could undermine legal defensibility
- Enforces business rules at the model layer (defense in depth)
- Provides clear error messages when invalid modifications are attempted
- Supports audit and compliance requirements (Tier 3)

Negative / tradeoffs:
- Requires corrections to be handled through compensating transactions (new records) rather than edits
- May require admin override workflows for legitimate corrections (future enhancement)
- Slightly more complex data model with validation overhead

Risks:
- Edge cases where legitimate corrections are needed must be handled through documented processes
- Staff training required to understand immutability constraints

Alternatives considered
- Application-level validation only: rejected due to weaker guarantees (can be bypassed via shell, direct DB access)
- No immutability enforcement: rejected due to audit and legal risk
- Soft-lock with admin override: deferred to future implementation (would require break-glass audit logging)

Implementation
- `src/modules/crm/models.py`: Contract model `clean()` method validates signed field immutability
- `src/modules/crm/models.py`: Proposal model `clean()` method prevents amount changes when contract exists
- `src/modules/projects/models.py`: TimeEntry model `save()` method blocks edits to invoiced entries
- Tests added/updated to validate immutability constraints

Spec impact
- SYSTEM_SPEC.md: Immutability invariants for legal and billing records
- DOMAIN_MODEL.md: Contract, Proposal, and TimeEntry model constraints
- BILLING_LEDGER_SPEC.md: Invoiced time entry immutability requirement

## ADR-0010: Tenancy model is firm-scoped row-level isolation (not schema-per-tenant)
Status: Accepted  
Date: 2025-12-29  
Owners: Platform  
Related: SYSTEM_SPEC.md (Tenancy); ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md; docs/1; docs/3; docs/5; docs/19; docs/24

Context  
- ADR-0001 stated "schema-per-tenant" as the tenancy model.
- The actual codebase implementation uses **firm-scoped row-level isolation** (every model has a `firm` ForeignKey).
- This contradiction exists across docs/1, docs/3, docs/5, docs/19, and docs/24.
- The working code represents the actual, tested, production-ready tenancy model.

Decision  
- **The canonical tenancy model is firm-scoped row-level isolation**, not schema-per-tenant.
- All relevant documentation must be updated to reflect this reality.
- ADR-0001 is hereby **superseded** by this ADR.
- Schema-per-tenant MAY be reconsidered in the future for enterprise/regulated customers requiring physical isolation, but is NOT the current implementation.

Rationale for Row-Level Tenancy (as implemented):
1. **Operational simplicity**: Single schema simplifies migrations, backups, queries, and monitoring.
2. **Django ecosystem fit**: Row-level tenancy is idiomatic for Django ORM; schema switching adds complexity.
3. **Query enforcement**: FirmScopedQuerySet and permission middleware enforce isolation at query layer.
4. **Current scale**: SMB SaaS workloads do not require physical schema isolation.
5. **Proven pattern**: All existing code, tests, and deployments use row-level isolation.

When schema-per-tenant should be reconsidered:
- Enterprise customers requiring compliance certifications (SOC2 Type II dedicated environment)
- Regulated industries with contractual data residency requirements
- Customers requiring dedicated encryption keys per schema

Consequences  
Positive:
- Documentation now matches reality.
- No migration required; current implementation is correct.
- Simpler operational model for the current product stage.

Negative / tradeoffs:
- Row-level tenancy has higher blast radius for tenant leakage bugs (mitigated by FirmScopedQuerySet).
- Cross-tenant analytics are easier but require explicit authorization.

Migration path to schema-per-tenant (if needed later):
1. Introduce django-tenants or custom schema routing middleware.
2. Add schema provisioning workflow to onboarding.
3. Migrate data per-firm to dedicated schemas.
4. Update connection routing based on request context.

Spec impact  
- docs/1: Update "Multi-tenancy" description from "schema-per-tenant" to "firm-scoped row-level isolation"
- docs/3: Update "Tenancy model" section
- docs/5: Update tenancy invariant statement
- docs/19: Reframe as optional future enhancement, not current blueprint
- docs/24: Update security model tenancy description
- ADR-0001: Mark as superseded by ADR-0010
